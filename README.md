ROS is a robot development system built on Ubuntu, consisting of a series of software packages and communication architecture. For users who may be more familiar with Windows, Ubuntu might be less familiar, which can present additional challenges when learning ROS. Fortunately, the rapid development of the internet industry in China has led to numerous books and online resources about Ubuntu and Linux, making self-learning much more accessible. When it comes to learning ROS, developers can choose suitable methods based on their own circumstances. Here are two suggestions that may be helpful:

For developers who have sufficient time and patience for learning, it is recommended to start by studying the usage of Ubuntu through books and online tutorials. Then, explore the ROS official wiki to gain a detailed understanding of ROS and its various concepts. Implement the tutorials and examples provided in the ROS official wiki to gain hands-on experience. Finally, return to this tutorial (note that some programming experiments in this tutorial may need modifications due to different navigation components, but they can provide programming insights).

For developers with tight project deadlines or less patience for theoretical learning, it is possible to start practicing with this tutorial directly. Quickly get the robot up and running to avoid extinguishing the enthusiasm for learning with tedious theory. After gaining a general experience with ROS through the exercises in this tutorial, go back and fill any gaps in theoretical knowledge.
